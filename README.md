# GReAT-BeD - graph rewriting rules repository

## How to use the ruleset to rewrite an example graph

1. Install [AGG 2.1](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/o.runge/AGG/WWW/down_V21_java8/index.html)
2. Clone the repo
3. Open AGG 2.1
4. In AGG, open the BehaviourAnalysis.ggx file
5. Select any behaviour graph at the top of the list (names are preceded by `example_`)
6. Click on the red **S** symbol on the last line of menu buttons, towards the right

## Potential issues

If AGG 2.1 is not starting, make sure you're using Java 8, as the latest JRE releases are seemingly unable to run AGG 2.1.
