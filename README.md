# To be named - graph rewriting rules repository

## How to use the ruleset to rewrite an example graph

1. Install AGG 2.1
2. Clone the repo
3. Open AGG 2.1
4. In AGG, open the BehaviourAnalysis.ggx file
5. Select any behaviour graph at the top of the list (names are preceded by `example_`)
6. Click on the red **S** symbol on the last line of menu buttons, towards the right

## Potential issues

If AGG 2.1 is not starting, make sure you're using Java 8, as the latest JRE releases are seemingly unable to run AGG 2.1.
